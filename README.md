Mark of the Inquisition
=======================

Found [Mark_of_the_Inquisition.stl](Mark_of_the_Inquisition.stl) somewhere on the webs ... not sure where.

Mark_of_the_Inquisition - Double sided
--------------------------------------

Created [Mark_of_the_Inquisition - Double sided.blend](Mark_of_the_Inquisition%20-%20Double%20sided.blend) to create a a double sided (and slightly thicker) version, which was then exported to "Mark_of_the_Inquisition - Double sided-Mark_of_the_Inquisition.stl".

"Mark_of_the_Inquisition - Double sided-Mark_of_the_Inquisition.stl" was then renamed to [Mark_of_the_Inquisition - Double sided.stl](Mark_of_the_Inquisition%20-%20Double%20sided.stl) because JLC's 3D print service doesn't like long names.
